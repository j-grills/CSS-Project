  <h1>Urgent Care Crisis</h1>

  <p> <img src="Urgent Care.jpg">

    <br> In Waller County, the absence of Urgent care is at the forefront of the many issues here. Local Residents feel
    as if they do not have anywhere to go if they receive some sort of injury. With the closest one being almost 30
    minutes away, their concerns are completely justified. During the Pandemic, many residents had issues with receiving
    any type of medical support besides a simple Covid-19 home test. An issue like that and the way it was handled gave
    people a complete realization of how important these medical centers are. When the renovation of this county begins,
    we think adding an Urgent care center should be the first, if not one of the first improvements. </br>


  <h4>
    <center><b>Profit</b></center>

    <br> While an Urgent Care center is good for the people requiring medical assistance, it also brings in more job
    opportunities for the people in the area. More job opportunities equal more people moving to this area which can
    bring many other types of businesses to Waller. </br>
