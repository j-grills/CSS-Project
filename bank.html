<h3>Why Does Prarie View Need More Banks?</h3>  
  <p>Prairie View, a city a part of Waller County is a small rural town with a low population and limited resources. Having a small rural town does not justify having limited resources, especially financial institutions. I am a resident of Waller County who lives in Prairie View and I can contest that there are not enough banks that are close and accessible to us Students of Prairie View.</p>
  
  <p>Putting this in Perspective the closest Chase(J.P Morgan) bank is 20 minutes away from campus in Cypress,TX in a different County. This needs to be fixed, a town needs provide all financial resources for it's residents. There are only 10 banks in Waller County. That number has to be fixed in order for us college students to handle our money.</p>
